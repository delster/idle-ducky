## What is Idle Ducky?

Idle ducky is an idle game created for my individual final project for NYCDA's Web Dev Intensive boot camp. It's a twist on generic clickers where the "duck pen" becomes the limiting factor of growth.

## Why Rubber Ducks?

You should just head over to [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) for some backstory. The tl;dr idea is that by explaining your buggy code line-by-line to a rubber duck, the cause of the bugs will become apparent to you. This idle game isn't about writing code and debugging it, merely inspired by _Rubber Duck Debugging_.
