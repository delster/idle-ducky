# Idle Ducky

## What is Idle Ducky?

Idle ducky is an idle game created for my individual final project for NYCDA's Web Dev Intensive boot camp. It's a twist on generic clickers where the "duck pen" becomes the limiting factor of growth.

## Why Rubber Ducks?

You should just head over to [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) for some backstory. The tl;dr idea is that by explaining your buggy code line-by-line to a rubber duck, the cause of the bugs will become apparent to you. This idle game isn't about writing code and debugging it, merely inspired by _Rubber Duck Debugging_.

## Stack

WIP. So far? [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) does the HTML templating (HTML is ugly, isn't it?), vanilla CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. There's some ES6 syntactic sugar and modules. The front-end stuff is [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/).

## Installation

This is placeholder text, but I plan to host this somewhere you can just play it. The source code is available here on GitHub, so if you'd like to fork it or contribute, feel free. For now, the index.pug file is compiled to index.html and should run as-is. If you get a CORS error, you'll need to serve the files up through a server as opposed to the filesystem.

## License

MIT? Look, everything's free. Free to use, reproduce, modify, sell, whatever. You do you. If you'd like to drop me a credit or buy me a beer, that's great. If you don't, that's fine, too.
